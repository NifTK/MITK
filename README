Introduction
============

This repository is a version of MITK, as used by the NifTK project.

The original MITK is here:
http://git.mitk.org/MITK.git

The original MITK is mirrored to GitHub here:
https://github.com/MITK/MITK

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/MITK/MITK.


Updating the master branch
==========================

The master branch should exactly match the MITK master. We update
a local branch here, just so we have a reference of which commit
we think we have merged up to.

So:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/MITK/MITK
git checkout master
git pull upstream master


Updating the niftk branch
=========================

git checkout niftk
git merge --no-ff master


Differences between niftk branch and master branch
==================================================

The NifTK project aims to have as few differences as possible between
this version of MITK and the original MITK. All bugfixes should be 
raised in the MITK bugzilla http://bugs.mitk.org/ and then a branch
created here, forking from master and using the branch naming convention

bug-<MITK bugzilla number>-trac-<trac ticket number>-description

for example

bug-16074-trac-2742-run-app-from-current-dir

MITK can then merge the bugfix into their code, and we pick up the fix
when we update our master branch, and consequently merge into the
niftk branch.

There are however cases where the NifTK project requires functional differences.
Again, these should be as few as possible.  In this case there may or may not
be a bugzilla bug report raised with MITK, so the branch naming convention should
either be the same as the above, or just

trac-<trac ticket number>-description 

These functional differences should still be forked from master so that if MITK 
want to merge it back to their code-base, they can. We would however immediately
merge it into the niftk branch once testing was complete.

Known Differences between niftk branch and master branch
========================================================

The following is a list of differences as of 2013-10-04:

1. Provide property to turn off black background in Geometry2DDataVtkMapper3D.

https://github.com/NifTK/MITK/commit/a0468dcee1ed33b85244e16c199ff715a61e8720

It was found that an image used as a plane in a 3D window using 
mitkGeometry2DDataVtkMapper3D.h would be visible in one 3D window, and not
in another 3D window. This may be related to MITK bug 2134. 

2. Provide ability to drag and drop nodes in DataManager, so that
   the dropped node becomes a child of the drop target.

3. Temporarily set library path directly due to CTK not exporting library.
