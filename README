Introduction
============

This repository is a version of MITK, as used by the NifTK project.

The original MITK is here:
http://git.mitk.org/MITK.git

The original MITK is mirrored to GitHub here:
https://github.com/MITK/MITK

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/MITK/MITK.


Updating the master branch
==========================

The master branch should exactly match the MITK master. We update
a local branch here, just so we have a reference of which commit
we think we have merged up to.

So:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/MITK/MITK
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master


Updating the niftk branch
=========================

git checkout niftk
git merge --no-ff master

(and try to put something useful in the commit message)


Differences between niftk branch and master branch
==================================================

The NifTK project aims to have as few differences as possible between
this version of MITK and the original MITK. All bugfixes should be 
raised in the MITK bugzilla http://bugs.mitk.org/ and then a branch
created here, forking from master and using the branch naming convention

bug-<MITK bugzilla number>-trac-<trac ticket number>-description

for example

bug-16074-trac-2742-run-app-from-current-dir

MITK can then merge the bugfix into their code, and we pick up the fix
when we update our master branch, and consequently merge into the
niftk branch.

There are however cases where the NifTK project requires functional differences.
Again, these should be as few as possible.  In this case there may or may not
be a bugzilla bug report raised with MITK, so the branch naming convention should
either be the same as the above, or just

trac-<trac ticket number>-description 

These functional differences should still be forked from master so that if MITK 
want to merge it back to their code-base, they can. We would however immediately
merge it into the niftk branch once testing was complete.


Known Differences between niftk branch and master branch
========================================================

The following is a list of differences as of 2013-10-06:

1. Branch: trac-2711-MITK-README

   This README was added, and which is then updated from many branches.

2. Branch: trac-2717-patched-Geometry2DDataVtkMapper3D

   Provide property to turn off black background in Geometry2DDataVtkMapper3D.

   It was found that an image used as a plane in a 3D window using 
   mitkGeometry2DDataVtkMapper3D.h would be visible in one 3D window, and not
   in another 3D window. This may be related to MITK bug 2134. 

3. Branch: trac-2571-data-manager-dnd-derived-nodes

   Provide ability to drag and drop nodes in DataManager, so that
   the dropped node becomes a child of the drop target.

4. Branch: trac-3528-QmitkDataStorageComboBox-autoselection-fix

   Change node-auto-selection behaviour for QmitkDataStorageComboBox to no
   select anything if the Combobox is editable. It used to select a node
   despite auto-selection being turned off if nothing had been selected yet.
   Now it will preserve the user entered text (if any) and the fact that
   nothing has been selected.

Tickets that are Outstanding (waiting to be merged) with MITK
=============================================================

The following is a list of differences as of 2014-06-24:

1. Branch bug-16698-trac-3038-points-cannot-be-removed-from-pointset

   Fixes of inconsistent state of point sets after point removal.

2. Branch bug-16862-trac-3124-disable-repositioning-displayed-region-on-window-resize

   Introduces a flag to disable automatic repositioning and rescaling the displayed
   region when a render window is resized.

3. Branch bug-16895-trac-2627-block-snc-signals

   Introduces a function to block signals from mitk::SliceNavigationController.

4. Branch bug-17534-trac-3298-DnD-crash

   Fix for DnD crash on Win64 with VS 2012.

5. Branch bug-17829-trac-3513-unique-renderer-names

   MITK now requires unique naming of renderers. This fix allows to specify a prefix for QmitkStdMultiWidget renderers.

6. Branch bug-17830-trac-3517-display-geometry-zoom-with-1.0-factor

   The origin changed when zooming with 1.0 factor what confused the DnD display that thought it's panning, not zooming.

7. Branch bug-17894-trac-3507-focus-always-moved-when-renderer-deleted

   Focus manager fix. Focus was put an eventually not visible renderer when any
   renderer had been removed, even if the removed renderer did not have the focus.

8. Branch bug-15427-trac-3594-cli-timeout

   Enables better handling of timeouts when getting XML from CLIs.
   This has been merged to MITK master. But this current niftk branch
   is based on MITK-2014.03. So, I manually merged it here to have access to
   this feature. As and when we update to the latest MITK, we will 
   be in synch.

9. Branch bug-18067-file-extensions-on-save was branched from master.

   At this point, the NifTK/MITK/master branch was AFTER the MITK-2014.03, so 
   I had to cherry-pick commit e01e4bc989ccf6b94c0f0f50a358f5950f52d3e4 onto niftk.
   Then I update this README.

   The purpose of this change is that the CLI stuff does not currently run,
   if fileExtension attribute contains dots. So the .xsd in CTK allows both
   with and without leading dot, but prohibits asterisks. See CTK #487.
